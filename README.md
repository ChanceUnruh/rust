This repository is a work in progress as I learn Rust!

## About

I’m currently diving into Rust and will be updating this repo as I go. The main goal of this repository is to showcase various projects that I’ll be working on, particularly related to microcontrollers and ROS 2. I'll be using Rust for system-level programming and hope to expand into real-time applications and robotics.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a memory-safe programming language, which means it helps prevent bugs like memory leaks and buffer overflows by enforcing strict rules around memory management. Since I’m only human and can make mistakes, I chose to learn Rust because its safety features make it easier to write safe and efficient code. This is especially useful in robotics, where reliability and stability are critical.

## What's in Progress

- Learning Rust basics and syntax
- Developing microcontroller projects
- Exploring ROS 2 integration with Rust

Feel free to check back often as I'll be making updates, testing, and pushing new features regularly.
